# Synthesis-Project-I: AI mentor program
The goal of this project is to identify students who might be at risk of failing by using past academic data and machine learning. This helps schools to support students early, before problems happen. The project has two main parts: first, giving teachers useful information about their classes and students; second, sending alert messages to students at risk, with activities and exercises to help them succeed.

### Key Features
- Predict students who are at risk of academic failure.
- Send automated alerts to students and professors.
- Web integration.
